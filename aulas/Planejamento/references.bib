abstract="In the first half of the year, 1941, an unusual number of cases of congenital cataract made their appearance in Sydney. Cases of similar type, which appeared during the same period, have since been reported from widely separated parts of Australia. Their frequency, unusual characteristics and wide distribution warranted closer investigation, and this report is an attempt to bring to notice some of the more important features of what might almost be regarded as a mild epidemic.",

	abstract = {Background In a previous study, we concluded that a safety helmet can reduce the risk for head injury by 60\%. Other studies reported similar effects, resulting in a general recommendation to wear a helmet while skiing or snowboarding.Aim To determine the effect of the expected increased helmet wear on the risk of head injury one decade after the recommendation.Methods Ski patrols reported injury cases in major Norwegian alpine ski resorts. Injury type, helmet use and other risk factors were recorded. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relation between individual risk factors and the risk of head injuries by comparing head injured skiers (cases) with skiers and snowboarders who reported other injuries (controls).Results Helmet use was associated with improved odds for head injuries (OR: 0.45, 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.60; p\&lt;0.001) in 2002; this effect was attenuated in 2010 (OR: 0.79, 95\% CI 0.63 to 0.98; p=0.02), and not significant in 2011 (OR: 0.80, 95\% CI 0.60 to 1.06; p=0.12). For potentially severe head injuries, the protective effect of using a helmet was better sustained over the observation period, from an OR of 0.44 (95\% CI 0.28 to 0.68, p\&lt;0.001) in 2002 to an OR of 0.74 (95\% CI 0.57 to 0.97, p=0.02) in 2010 and 0.67 (95\% CI 0.47 to 0.96; p=0.03) in 2011.Conclusions We observed an unexpected reduction in the protective effect of a skiing helmet. This may be due to new skiing trends in the alpine resorts.},

abstract = {Although the rise in ischaemic heart disease in England and Wales has been associated with increasing prosperity, mortality rates are highest in the least affluent areas. On division of the country into two hundred and twelve local authority areas a strong geographical relation was found between ischaemic heart disease mortality rates in 1968-78 and infant mortality in 1921-25. Of the twenty-four other common causes of death only bronchitis, stomach cancer, and rheumatic heart disease were similarly related to infant mortality. These diseases are associated with poor living conditions and mortality from them is declining. Ischaemic heart disease is strongly correlated with both neonatal and postneonatal mortality. It is suggested that poor nutrition in early life increases susceptibility to the effects of an affluent diet.}
